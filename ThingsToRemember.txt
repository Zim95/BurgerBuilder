1) Setting up CSS module:
        Option 1: We can design stuff in a CSS file and import it. They will be global though. 
                  This doesnt allow us to have same classnames accross multiple components which might result in a problem.
                  For example:
                    CSS files are global which means they will overwrite the styles for a component.
                    Suppose we have person.js file which is styled by person.css.
                    It is very hectic to come up with different classnames for each component.
                    Say, person.css has a class of btn which it styles.
                    And say there is another component app.js which uses app.css which also has a class btn.
                    Since the CSS classes are global wew can only import either person.css or App.css into App.js
                    Or, into Person.js.
                    But sadly our bundling tool will have a conflict on these classes.
                    The class btn that they both have will create a conflict.
                    Therefore, we tend to have css styles only scoped to a certain Javascript file and that is where Option 2 comes in. 
        Option 2: We can have inline styles in the js file itself. 
                  This will allow us to have our CSS scope limited to a JS file.
                  Create a style variable like style = {property:value} and set <component style={style}/>.
                  This has a problem as we will need to use pseudo-selectors like :hover, @media.
                  For this we have Radium. We will need to create a higher order Radium component that is Radium(<Component>).
                  Now we can use pseudo selectors by something like this:
                    style = {
                        property:xyz
                        ":pseudo":{
                            property:abc
                        }
                    } 
                  However there will still be a problem for media queries. For which we use <StyleRoot>.
                  We import this and then wrap our final component with this and then pass the overall result to Radium.
                  Problem is, it is better to have our styles in a separate file rather than inline.
                  But we already know that this creates a problem because of the global scope issue in Option 1.
        Option 3: CSS Modules, lets us scope a particular CSS file to only a single JS file.
                  This lets us separate CSS from our JS code and also prevents it from having a global scope.

        Steps for option 3:
        a. Initialize a git repository. Git add and Git commit, otherwise step B will not work.
        b. npm run eject
        c. Step b will give us access to the config folder which will appear automatically.
           There, we will find webpack.config.js.
           There, look for:
            {
              test: cssRegex,
              exclude: cssModuleRegex,
              use: getStyleLoaders({
                  sourceMap: isEnvProduction && shouldUseSourceMap
                }),
                // Don't consider CSS imports dead code even if the
              // containing package claims to have no side effects.
              // Remove this when webpack adds a warning or an error for this.
              // See https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/6571
              sideEffects: true,
            },

            And turn it into,
            {
              test: cssRegex,
              exclude: cssModuleRegex,
              use: getStyleLoaders({
                importLoaders: 1,
                modules: true,
                localIdentIName: '[name]__[local]__[hash:base64:5]',
                sourceMap: isEnvProduction && shouldUseSourceMap
              }),
              // Don't consider CSS imports dead code even if the
              // containing package claims to have no side effects.
              // Remove this when webpack adds a warning or an error for this.
              // See https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/6571
              sideEffects: true,
            }, 
    
    NOTE: It is said that CSS modules are already enabled by default, so do try without this step.
    UPDATE: This step is necessary for css modules to work.

2. Create a higher order auxillary component:
    a. In react everything should be inside a div.
        However we have two workarounds.
        One: We could return both elemets inside as an array with unique keys assigned.
        Two: We can pass this complete component into another component creating a higher order component.
                The higher order component will simply return whatever is wrapped inside of it.
                And we will use that component to wrap our divs and main to give an illusion of a single component.

            NOTE: All our higher order components are in the hoc folder.

    b. We can also create higher order components and use them like functions. Like how we used Radium, and withRouter.
        To see what a functional hoc looks like refer: withErrorHandler.js

3.  Architecture:
    1. Layout contains the layout of the whole SPA. ToolBars and all that. 
        Here, we switch only between containers by using routes.
    2. Containers are like pages. One route is attached to one container which 
        inturn is made up of components.
    3. Components are used in containers. If there are any sub components, 
        they deserve a folder of their own.

4. Map-Reduce:
    We know what map does, i.e maps each element of a list to a function. It's the same in python.
    Now reduce is able to work on the array produced by maps.

5. Axios:
    Alot of things to remember. I'll write them down when I can put them into words.

    a. Do not get confused between DidMount and DidUpdate. setState will update the dom, i.e it will re render. 
    Did Mount will only be called once. Therefore, an infinite loop is observed in DidUpdate when setState is called there.
    In DidMount this method will be called only once. Therefore, it is not a threat.
    However, we may need to use setState on DidUpdate based on our usecase. For example, 
    If we need to get some data after the component has already been rendered, then we will need to use it in DidUpdate.
    Like some click event that will trigger the HTTP Request. The component is already there and DidMount has already been executed.
    However, we can use DidUpdate as that method will be called upon recieving props and will decide whether we need to rerender based on props.
    Therefore, we need to use DidUpdate here.
    However, to avoid an infinite loop we will add custom checks and fire the http request and setState only if the check is valid.
    For example, if the data is recieved, then we need not send the request over and over again.

6. Routing:
    a. The index should wrap its app component in BrowserRouter.
    b. In app.js we set up the routes, we use Route component for that. All components rendered by Route component 
        have access to history and match properties. However, these properties are not accessible to sub components.
        One way to make them accessible is by passing them to subcomponents as well.
        However, wwe use a higher order component called withRouter just like withErrorHandler(that we created).
        Each subcomponent can be a withRouter() hoc component and this will also allow those subcomponents to have history
        and map.
        NOTE: history can be used for navigation whereas map can be used to obtain query params and all.
                Investigate the properties by using console log
    c. path property in Route component will have "/" and "/something". However, this kind of works as regex.
        So in this path: "/something", both "/" and "/something" will match. Therefore both components will be loaded.
        We can solve this in the following ways:
            i.   Use exact: exact will evaluate the regex exactly as it is mentioned. However, there may be problems
                            when we need to constantly keep adding the base url to every route.
            ii.  Use switch: <Switch></Switch> component from 'react-router-dom' can be used to only display one of these routes.
                            Problem when we enter a route '/something' we cannot have '/' evaluated before '/something'.
                            Since we dont use exact anymore, '/something' will pass the check for '/' and since we are using 
                            switch, only one will be evaluated and we will end up with the component in '/' route.
                            Therefore, we need to place '/something' evaluation before '/' evaluation.
    d. in the history property when we push the page into stack we usually give it a url. However, this can also be an object.
        this.props.history.push({
            pathname: '/<url>',
            search:'queryparams'
        })
    e. You can always render components like this: <Route path="/" component={Component}/>. But this way, wew will never be able to add properties.
        So we can use render to rather execute a function. Since, render is just a render method.
        What we normally did,
            <Route path="/" render={<h1>Stuff</h1>}/>
            This is like returning simple jsx
        Now, what we do is,
            <Route path="/" render={()=>(<Component props={...stuff}/>);}
        This basically allows us to render components by passing props.
    f.This is very important:
        When we have links for different routes on the navbar, we commonly use <a></a> tags and then set it's href properties to redirect.
        However, when doing this we will end up reloading the page.
        This means all state will be lost.
        To avoid this we use a Component called <NavLink/> provided by react-router-dom.
        Navlink:
            - Navlink can be used to replace <a></a> tags so that we do not reload the whole page.
                and do not reset the state.
            - Instead of href it has a "to" property which we can use to set urls.
            - It also has it's own active class. Using which it will automatically set a link to active upon visit.
            - We can overwrite the style for this active class in our CSS file.
            - Problem is our CSS module will translate the active class to something else. Some encrypted value as we have seen.
            - To solve this, <Navlink/> also has a property called activeClassName which will allow us to tell Navlink,
                which of our own CSS encrypted classNames will be assigned to it's active class.
            - Also, we will face another problem, as we know, all routes that have '/' in front like '/checkout' or '/something'
                will pass the check for '/'.
            - This means that for '/' only one link will be active, but for '/something', both '/' and '/something' Links will be active.
            - This can be solved using the exact property.
            - In our case, we have a NavigationItem component which we styled and a NavigtaionItems component 
                which is a collection of multiple NavigtaionItem component.
            - If wew set exact to NavigationItem the problem is it will apply exact to true to all NavigationItem components.
            - We do not want that. Therefore, in the collection component we need to specify where we need to set exact property to true.
            - Checkout NavigationItems.js and NavigationItem.js for reference.

7. Styling:
    a. When we want to have different property values for a single component when it is imported in different layouts.
        We can pass the height via props.
        Or we can overwrite it's css locally.
        Check out Logo class on Toolbar and Sidebar for reference.
    b. When using {...props} in <input/> element be sure to add it before "className" property. Like, <input {...props} className={classes.clsnm}/>
    c. Incase you want to check the hashed classname from css modules. Simply console.log it. Like, console.log(classes.<classname>);
8. Syntax: Arrays, object immutability. talk about that.
9. Lifecycle: Talk about all lifecycle methods.
10. Redux: 
    Once, the redux devtools are installed, we need to do this to the store for it to run:
    const store = createStore(reducer, window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__());
11. Testing:
    JEST = Test Runner -> executes the test code as per a certain environment 
            (because the actual environment is nodejs but javascript libraries change the environment to emulate a browser)
            and provides a validation library (a library that allows us to do comparisons and throw errors).
    ENZYME = Testing Utilities -> Emulating the components for Test Runner. 
             Otherwise how else will we give the test runner, an illusion of the component being loaded.
             It's like mounting them to some non-existent dom.
             To install enzyme:
             -> enzyme: core package
             -> Two additional packages are required to make enzyme work correctly with JEST and REACT.
                --> react-test-renderer: Dependency of enzyme that we need to install separately.
                --> enzyme-adapter-react-16: Enzyme adapter to connect it to react 16.
